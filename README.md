This is an app to help kids to control their stamp´s collection.

A few ideas for  next version

- it would be great to reflect changes in db without having to refresh page each time, for faster usability

-mejorar login page, para atender el caso de login incorrecto

- add ability to update username (can check some info on subject here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkUmN9TH_hQ&t=6s
